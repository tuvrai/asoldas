# asoldas

The web app that lets you discover that you are as old as another person during significant event to the precision of a single day.

## events
It uses Wikipedia events, scrapped from pages for every day within year (such as [January 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_17), [September 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_23) etc.), linked with people detected in a given event.

## todo
Obviously more events, as many of the Wikipedia ones, altough significant, might be boring.
